Problem Statement:

Alice wrote a sequence of words in CamelCase as a string of letters,s , having the following properties:
-> It is a concatenation of one or more words consisting of English letters.
-> All letters in the first word are lowercase.
-> For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is uppercase and rest of the letters are lowercase.
Given s, print the number of words in s on a new line.
For example, s=oneTwoThree. There are 3 words in the string.


Solution:


def camelcase(s):
    cnt=1
    for i in s:
        if i.isupper():
            cnt+=1
    return(cnt)

s = input()
result = camelcase(s)
print(result)
