Problem Statement:

Little Bobby loves chocolate. He frequently goes to his favorite 5 & 10 store, Penny Auntie, to buy them. They are having a promotion at Penny Auntie. 
If Bobby saves enough wrappers, he can turn them in for a free chocolate.
For example, Bobby has n=15 to spend on bars of chocolate that cost c=3 each. He can turn in m=2 wrappers to receive another bar. Initially, he buys 5 bars and has 5 wrappers after eating them. 
He turns in 2 of them, leaving him with 1, for 2 more bars. After eating those two, he has 3 wrappers, turns in 2 leaving him with 1 wrapper and his new bar. Once he eats that one, he has 2 wrappers and turns them in for another bar. 
After eating that one, he only has 1 wrapper, and his feast ends. Overall, he has eaten 5+2+1+1=9 bars.


Solution:

def chocolateFeast(n, c, m):
    total=n//c
    wrapper=total
    while(wrapper>=m):
        total+=1
        wrapper-=m
        wrapper+=1
    return(total)

t = int(input())
for t_itr in range(t):
    n,c,m = map(int,input().split())
    result = chocolateFeast(n, c, m)
    print(result)
