Problem Statement:

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:
> Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
> Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
> If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
> If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

For example, 84 will be rounded to 85 but grade=29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.
Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.



Solution:

def gradingStudents(grades): 
    # Write your code here
    Rounded=[]
    for i in grades:
        if i<38:
            Rounded.append(i)
        elif (5-(i%5))<3:
            Rounded.append(i+(5-(i%5)))
        else:
            Rounded.append(i)
    return Rounded
            

grades_count = int(input().strip())
grades = []
for _ in range(grades_count):
    grades_item = int(input().strip())
    grades.append(grades_item)
result = gradingStudents(grades)
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
