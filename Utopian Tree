Problem Statement:

The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.
Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after n growth cycles?
For example, if the number of growth cycles is n = 5, the calculations are as follows:

Period  Height
0          1
1          2
2          3
3          6
4          7
5          14


Solution:

def utopianTree(n):
    cnt=0
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i%2==0:
            cnt+=1
        else:
            cnt*=2
    return(cnt)
t = int(input())
for t_itr in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    result = utopianTree(n)
    print(result)
