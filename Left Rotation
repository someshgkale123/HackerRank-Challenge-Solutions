Problem Statement:

A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].
Given an array of n integers and a number,d , perform d left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.


Solution:

#!/bin/python3


nd = input().split()
n = int(nd[0])
d = int(nd[1])

a = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(*(a[d:]+a[:d]))
