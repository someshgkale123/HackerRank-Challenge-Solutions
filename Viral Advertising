Problem Statement:

HackerLand Enterprise is adopting a new viral advertising strategy. When they launch a new product, they advertise it to exactly 5 people on social media.
On the first day, half of those 5 people (i.e.,floor(5/2)=2 ) like the advertisement and each shares it with 3 of their friends. At the beginning of the second day, 
floor(5/2)*3 = 2*3 = 6 people receive the advertisement.
Each day, floor(recipients/2) of the recipients like the advertisement and will share it with 3 friends on the following day. Assuming nobody receives the advertisement twice,
determine how many people have liked the ad by the end of a given day, beginning with launch day as day 1.

Solution:

def viralAdvertising(n):
    cnt=2
    number=2
    for i in range(n-1):
        cnt+=(number*3)//2
        number=(number*3)//2
    return(cnt) 

n = int(input())
result = viralAdvertising(n)
print(result)
