Problem Statment:

An English text needs to be encrypted using the following encryption scheme. First, the spaces are removed from the text. Let L be the length of this text.
Then, characters are written into a grid, whose rows and columns have the following constraints:

For example, the sentence 
s= if man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots, after removing spaces is 54 characters long. sqrt(54) is between 7 and 8, so it is written in the form of a grid with 7 rows and 8 columns.

ifmanwas  
meanttos          
tayonthe  
groundgo  
dwouldha  
vegivenu  
sroots


Solution:

import math
def encryption(s):
    row=math.floor(math.sqrt(len(s)))
    column=math.ceil(math.sqrt(len(s)))
    stri=""
    for i in range(row+1):
        stri+=(s[i::column])+" "
    return(stri)

s = input()
result = encryption(s)
print(result)
