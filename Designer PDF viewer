Problem Statement:
When you select a contiguous block of text in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. 
In this PDF viewer, each word is highlighted independently. In this challenge, you will be given a list of letter heights in the alphabet and a string. 
Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in mm**2  assuming all letters are 1mm wide.
For example, word=torn . Assume the heights of the letters are t=20, O= 1, r=1 and n=1. 
The tallest letter is 2 high and there are 4 letters. The highlighted area will be 2*4=8mm**2 so the answer is 8.

Solution:
	def designerPdfViewer(h, word):
    		numbers = [h[(ord(i)-96)-1] for i in word]
    		return(max(numbers)*len(numbers)) 
  h = list(map(int, input().split()))
  word = input()
  result = designerPdfViewer(h, word)
 	print(result)
