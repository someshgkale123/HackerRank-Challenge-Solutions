Problem Statement:

Aerith is playing a cloud hopping game. In this game, there are sequentially numbered clouds that can be thunderheads or cumulus clouds. 
Her character must jump from cloud to cloud until it reaches the start again.
To play, Aerith is given an array of clouds, c and an energy level e=100. She starts from c[0] and uses 1 unit of energy to make a jump of size k to cloud c[(i+k)%n]. 
If Aerith lands on a thundercloud, c[i]=1, her energy (e) decreases by 2 additional units. The game ends when Aerith lands back on cloud 0.
Given the values of n, k, and the configuration of the clouds as an array c, can you determine the final value of e after the game ends?

For example, give c=[0,0,1,0] and k=2, the indices of her path are 0->2->0. Her energy level reduces by 1 for each jump to 98. She landed on one thunderhead at an additional cost of 2 energy units. 
Her final energy level is 96.


Solution:
def jumpingOnClouds(c, k):
    value=100
    for i in range(0,len(c),k):
        if c[i]==0:
            value-=1
        else:
            value-=3
    return(value)
    
n,k = map(int,input().split())
c = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
result = jumpingOnClouds(c, k)
print(result)
