Problem Statement:

An integer d is a divisor of an integer n if the remainder of n/d=0.
Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.
Note: Each digit is considered to be unique, so each occurrence of the same digit should be counted (e.g. for n=111, 1 is a divisor of 111 each time it occurs so the answer is 3).


Solution:


def findDigits(n):
    cnt=0
    for i in str(n):
        if i=='0':
            continue
        elif int(n)%int(i)==0:
            cnt+=1
        
    return(cnt)

t = int(input())
for t_itr in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    result = findDigits(n)
    print(result)
