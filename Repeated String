Problem Statement:

Lilah has a string, s, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.
Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of Lilah's infinite string.
For example, if the string s='abcac' and n=10, the substring we consider is abcacabcac, the first 10 characters of her infinite string. 
There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.

Solution:


def repeatedString(s, n):
    remainder=s[:n%len(s)].count('a')
    result=(n//len(s))*s.count('a')+remainder
    return(result)

s = input()
n = int(input())
result = repeatedString(s, n)
print(result)
