Problem Statement:

You have an empty sequence, and you will be given N queries. Each query is one of these three types:

1 x  -Push the element x into the stack.
2    -Delete the element present at the top of the stack.
3    -Print the maximum element in the stack.

Solution:

n=int(input())
li=[0]
for i in range(n):
    i=list(map(int,input().split()))
    if i[0]==1:
        li.append(max(i[1],li[-1]))
    elif i[0]==2:
        li.pop()
    elif i[0]==3:
        print(li[-1])
